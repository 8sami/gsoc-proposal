#### Project Proposal

* **Title**: Whatsapp bot for CARE
* **Project Overview**: 
    IM wrapper is a djano plugin based instant messaging provider meant to provide staff and patients ease of access to medical data through any messaging app, quickly and securely. 

    The provider approach makes the instant messaging functionality independant of any messaging app, ensuring each one's support can be developed, maintained and tested without intefering with other messaging provider's implementation.

    Developing it as a plugin ensures that we wont have to worry about interfering with care's backend. As a plugin, it can be removed, added, updated any time without affecting the core backend. This keeps the core backend clean and lean which ensures good maintainability and developer experience. 

    **Specification:**
    
    1. **Architecture**: Plugin based, using the the django cookie cutter template. 
    
    2. **Authentication**: Two step authentication, first is matching the requestor's phone number with the number associated with a patient or staff member in the database. The second step is asking for DOB to confirm identity. If the requestor fails to provide correct DOB within 3 attempts, the request is blocked for 15 minutes. 

    3. **Authorization**: The authorization is managed via the type of account (staff or patient) and roles permissions logic in the care backend. For example a patient can only access their own data, while a staff member can access the data of patients in their care.

    4. **Caching**:

    5. **Rate Limiting**:

    6. **Error Handling**:

    7. **Logging**:

    8. **Testing**:

    9. **Documentation**:

    10. **Deployment**:
  
    including my understanding and its use case

* **Features**: 
  1. List of five features I appreciate in the platform

#### Technical Skills and Relevant Experience

* My technical skills include Python, Javascript, Typescript, React, Nextjs, Django, Flask, SQL, Git, Github, Docker, Linux

* My first full stack project, "Simple Invoice Generator" was built using Django, weasyprint, crispy-bootstrap5 and jinja. That project recorded almost 2 Cr of transactions for a procurement service provider and then as I was developing its v2 using nextjs, shadcn, reactPDF and django ninja the business completed its tenure. I reviewed the code a few weeks ago... it needs a lot of work but I plan to deploy it as a free open source tool this year.

    I have a YOE working as a software dev remotely for an Australian agency where I got the chance to work on production grade code across various projects using different technologies and working in a high stakes environment has taught me a lot about problem solving while respecting the tight deadlines.

#### Implementation Timeline and Milestones

* Week-by-week plan outlining goals, tasks, and deliverables
* Specific milestones for project phases

#### Summary About Me

 I am a curious person. I mostly do things that seem fun to me and problem solving and product development are one of those things that i very much enjoy doing. I have more than an year of experience working as a software developer in an Australian agency which I resigned from in february to explore my interests and focus more on my studies to get into MIT. I started programming when I was in 9th grade as a hobby and its just as fun as it was back then.

 My motivation for winning gsoc is that it aligns with my goals, and I have developed a love for open source in the process. I genuinely enjoy contributing to something bigger than me, something that would go on to live and make people's lives easier even after me.

#### Availability and Commitment

* 40-50 hours per week
* I'll be studying for SAT and training for national powerlifting competition for 2-3 hours daily. Will be done with Board exams which are from 16 april to 25 april 2026 and I won't be preparing for entrance exams until next year.
